[{"content":"I am a PhD candidate in the Management Division at Columbia Business School.\nI study when and how entrepreneurship operates as a channel for individual upward mobility and as a solution to social problems. My research is at the intersection of entrepreneurship, inequality, and business and society, focusing on two related themes: (1) how individuals’ socioeconomic origins affect their entrepreneurial decision-making and outcomes; and (2) how entrepreneurs are motivated by creating social impact and solving specific problems. To answer these questions, I employ a variety of methods including field experiments, econometric analysis of archival data, and qualitative interviews. My work has been published in peer-reviewed academic journals including Management Science, PNAS, and Academy of Management Discoveries.\nMy job market paper focuses on how the socioeconomic backgrounds of entrepreneurs and investors shape startup investor behaviors, using a lab-in-the-field experiment on angel and venture capital investors. This work has been selected as a finalist for the 2023 Organization Science/INFORMS Dissertation Proposal Competition.\nPrior to starting my PhD, I received my MS and BBA in Strategy from Seoul National University. I grew up in Upstate New York and Seoul, Korea, and currently live in New York City. Outside of academia, I enjoy learning about dog training, going to anti-gravity yoga class, and playing electric guitar.\n","permalink":"https://jeanjhoh.github.io/about/","summary":"I am a PhD candidate in the Management Division at Columbia Business School.\nI study when and how entrepreneurship operates as a channel for individual upward mobility and as a solution to social problems.
