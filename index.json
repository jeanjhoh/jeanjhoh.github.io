[{"content":"I am a PhD candidate in the Management Division at Columbia Business School.\nMy research lies at the intersection of entrepreneurship and society. Specifically, I am studying (1) how founder socioeconomic backgrounds impact entrepreneurial outcomes and (2) when and which entrepreneurs are motivated to generate social impact and to solve grand challenges such as climate change. To answer these questions, I employ a variety of methods including field experiments, econometric analysis of archival data, and qualitative interviews. My work has been published in peer-reviewed academic journals including Management Science, PNAS, and Academy of Management Discoveries.\nMy job market paper focuses on how the socioeconomic backgrounds of entrepreneurs and investors shape startup investor behaviors, using a lab-in-the-field experiment on angel and venture capital investors.\nPrior to starting my PhD, I received my BBA and MS in Strategy from Seoul National University. I grew up in Upstate New York and Seoul, Korea, and currently live in New York City. Outside of academia, I enjoy learning about dog training, going to anti-gravity yoga class, and playing electric guitar.\n","permalink":"https://jeanjhoh.github.io/about/","summary":"I am a PhD candidate in the Management Division at Columbia Business School.\nMy research lies at the intersection of entrepreneurship and society.
