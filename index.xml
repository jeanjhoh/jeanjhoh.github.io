      <description>I am a PhD candidate in the Management Division at Columbia Business School.
My research lies at the intersection of entrepreneurship and society. Specifically, I am studying (1) how founder socioeconomic backgrounds impact entrepreneurial outcomes and (2) when and which entrepreneurs are motivated to generate social impact and to solve grand challenges such as climate change. To answer these questions, I employ a variety of methods including field experiments, econometric analysis of archival data, and qualitative interviews.</description>
