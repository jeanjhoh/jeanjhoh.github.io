      <description>I am a PhD candidate in the Management Division at Columbia Business School.
I study when and how entrepreneurship operates as a channel for individual upward mobility and as a solution to social problems. My research is at the intersection of entrepreneurship, inequality, and business and society, focusing on two related themes: (1) how individualsâ€™ socioeconomic origins affect their entrepreneurial decision-making and outcomes; and (2) how entrepreneurs are motivated by creating social impact and solving specific problems.</description>
